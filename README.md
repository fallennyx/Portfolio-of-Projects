# My Top Projects

## Car Finder

Repository: [Car Finder](https://github.com/fallennyx/Car-Finder)

Description: Our car finder site takes user input to display car information based on the most essential characteristics they care about, such as make and model. Car data is inserted into our database where users will be able to select a specific car and access information including the year, model, and make.

Tools used:
- Flask for the frontend
- Python for the backend
- Car Data API
- SQLite Database

## Fits in Advance

Repository: [Fits in Advance](https://github.com/fallennyx/Fits-in-Advance)
Description: Using the weather data of the user-inputted city, our app uses DALL-E to create an image of a recommended outfit. Search results of the recommended outfit are displayed - in case a user is missing some items.

## Country Facts Generator

Repository: [Country Facts Generator](https://github.com/fallennyx/CountryInfo))

Description: The Country Facts Generator is a user-friendly program designed to provide instant and reliable information about various countries. Users simply input the name of the country they are interested in, and the generator quickly retrieves the relevant facts. The generated information is organized and presented in a simple format, including details such as alternate spellings, region/continent, capital, currency, language, and timezone based on your current location. Our generator also prompts the user if they want to see the previous data stored in the database. If yes, it will print it; otherwise, it will stop and say "Have a nice day."

Tools used:
- PEP8 guidelines
- SQL database
